# Colab Notebook

This assignment is designed to be completable fully within Colab without requiring external file editing. You can find the Colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BUtvB3WdKM_TsMpc8P7CFjHXcm6RygTQ?usp=sharing

Make a copy of this notebook and upload the final resulting `my_llm_implementation.py` to GradeScope to be evaluated by the AutoGrader.

## (Not Recommended) Local Development

If you instead choose to do things on your local ipynb, you can find the corresponding file here. However, you should note that the assignment was developed and tested with Colab in mind. We won't spend time explicitly debugging environment differences if you choose to go this route.
